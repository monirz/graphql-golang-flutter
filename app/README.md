## Getting Started

This app is using [graphql-flutter](https://github.com/zino-app/graphql-flutter#readme) Dependency. I am using version 1.0.0 of this plugin.

Those who are on`flutter stable channel` will not able to use the version `1.0.0` of this plugin because it requires Dart Tool >= `2.2.0` && < `3.0.0` .On stable channel currently flutter is using Dart < `2.2.0` .

To solve this issue you need to move to the dev channel of flutter which is currently using Dart >= `2.2.0`.

### Let's check the Dart version of Flutter

```sh
$ flutter --version
Tools • Dart 2.1.x
```

You can see that `Tools • Dart 2.1.x` version is 2.1.0 ( < 2.2.0 ). So you need to change the channel, Here is instruction for changing the channel.

### To change the Channel

```sh
$ flutter channel dev
Switching to flutter channel 'dev'...

$ flutter channel
Flutter channels:
  beta
* dev
  master
  stable
```

Now you can clone this app and run in your Computer.

If you found any difficulties while running this app then feel free to open the issue.
